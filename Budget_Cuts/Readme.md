#Award Budget Cuts

The awards committee had planned to give n research grants this year, out of a its total yearly budget.
However, the budget was reduced to b dollars. The committee members has decided to affect the minimal number of highest grants, by applying a maximum cap c on all grants: every grant that was planned to be higher than c will now be c dollars.
Help the committee to choose the right value of c that would make the total sum of grants equal to the new budget.

Given an array of grants g and a new budget b, explain and code an efficient method to find the cap c. Assume that each grant is unique.
Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
